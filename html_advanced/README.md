# HTML Advanced

This project focuses on the advanced usage of **HTML** to build a webpage from a design mockup. The task is to implement the webpage structure using semantic HTML elements, ensuring proper structure, accessibility, and content organization, while preparing for future styling with CSS.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I will be able to:

- Understand what **HTML** is and its role in web development
- Create a web page structure from a **wireframe** or design file (Figma)
- Identify the importance of **semantic HTML tags** and use them correctly
- Implement various sections of a webpage using HTML elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, and `<section>`
- Understand and work with the **Document Object Model (DOM)**
- Understand the concept of **HTML attributes** and **elements**
- Create a **well-structured HTML document** that is W3C-compliant and ready for styling

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for structuring the webpage content
- **CSS3** – (future task: styling)
