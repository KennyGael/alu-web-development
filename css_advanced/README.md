# CSS Advanced

This project builds on the structure created in the **HTML Advanced** project by adding **CSS styling** to make the page visually match a provided Figma design. It focuses on applying advanced CSS concepts including layout techniques, typography, spacing, responsive design, and positioning.

> All styles are created using **pure CSS**.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I will be able to:

- Implement styles that match a design specification
- Use **flexbox** and other layout techniques for complex positioning
- Apply **typography**, **spacing**, and **color** based on a Figma mockup
- Understand how to work with **Figma designs**
- Organize CSS using reusable, modular classes
- Use **hover effects**, **buttons**, and **grid layouts**
- Build a consistent and responsive page from an HTML base

---

## Project Setup

- Copied the full `index.html` from the `html_advanced` directory
- Created a `README.md` presenting the project
- Linked a new `styles.css` stylesheet
- Verified structure against Figma design

---

## Visual Preview

> *Below is a visual mockup from the Figma design. Actual implementation will match this as closely as possible.*

## Notes

- Fonts required by the design: `Source Sans Pro` and `Spin-Cycle-OT`  
  Make sure to download and install them if they're missing on your system.

- All styling will be **W3C compliant** and validated using the W3C CSS validator.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – from previous project  
- **CSS3** – custom styles to match the design  
- **Figma** – for layout and style specifications  
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) – to ensure CSS validity

## Next Steps

- Apply detailed styles to each section using `styles.css`
- Make the layout responsive for mobile devices
- Match all visuals to the Figma file as closely as possible
