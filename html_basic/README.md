# HTML Basic

This project is the foundation of my web development journey. It covers the core concepts of HTML and how to structure a basic, accessible, and valid web page.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I was able to:

- Explain what HTML and a markup language are
- Describe the DOM (Document Object Model)
- Identify elements, tags, and attributes
- Understand how browsers load and render webpages
- Structure a webpage using semantic HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>`

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0. Structure` | Created a valid HTML file with basic structure (`base_index.html`) |
| `1. Make a cool first webpage` | Added paragraphs, headings, and a clickable image (`index.html`) |
| `2. Make a cool other webpage` | Embedded a Tweet and added internal navigation (`tweets.html`) |
| `3. Make a cool website` | Applied consistent structure with `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` and internal linking |

## Files in This Directory

- `base_index.html` — Minimal valid HTML boilerplate
- `index.html` — Main webpage with content and navigation
- `tweets.html` — Second webpage with embedded tweet and link back

## Validation

All HTML files have been validated using the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
